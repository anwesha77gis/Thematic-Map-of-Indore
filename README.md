Digitized Thematic Map of Indore (GIS Project)

This repository contains a *digitized thematic map* of *Indore*, created using GIS software.  
The map shows roads, waterbodies, green zones, and important landmarks with distinct symbology for easy visualization.

 Map Details
- *Location:* Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India
- *Data Source:* Digitized from a base map using GIS tools
- *Layers Included:*
  - Major Roads (Brown lines)
  - Minor Roads (White lines)
  - Railways (Black dashed lines)
  - Rivers/Streams (Blue lines)
  - Waterbodies (Blue polygons)
  - Vegetation/Green Areas (Green polygons)
  - Hospitals (Red Cross symbol)
  - Important Landmarks (Red star symbol)
Legend
| Symbol/Color | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| *Brown Line* | Major Road |
| *White Line* | Minor Road |
| *Black Dashed Line* | Railway |
| *Blue Line* | River/Stream |
| *Blue Polygon* | Waterbody |
| *Green Polygon* | Vegetation / Park |
| *Red Cross (+)* | Hospital |
| *Red Star* | Important Landmark |
 Tools Used
- *GIS Software:* QGIS (used for georeferencing, digitization, and styling)
- *Data Type:* Vector data (Line, Polygon, Point layers)
 Applications
This thematic map can be used for:
- Urban infrastructure planning
- Location analysis for new facilities
- Waterbody conservation projects
- Educational GIS demonstrations
 Workflow
1. *Georeferencing:* The scanned Indore basemap was georeferenced using known coordinates.
2. *Digitization:* Layers for roads, rivers, landmarks, vegetation, and hospitals were created.
3. *Styling:* Symbology applied to distinguish each feature type.
4. *Export:* Final thematic map exported for analysis and presentation.
 Note
- This map is a *thematic representation* and may not reflect real-time updates.
